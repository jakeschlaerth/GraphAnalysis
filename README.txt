when running GraphAnalysis as a Python3 script, the user will be prompted to enter a filename.
The filename entered should be a text file should contain the
number of wrestlers, n, followed by their names, the number of rivalries r and rivalries listed in pairs.
An example of user input of this filename would be:
data.txt

The file will then be analyzed and the results of the analysis will be output to the console.
If there is no possible classification of wrestlers such that each rival is on a different team,
the console will simply output "Impossible".
If there does exist some possible classification of wrestlers such that each rival is on a different team,
one possible solution will be output to the console.
